title=Vehicle Killswitch
description=This mod is an attempt to curtail vehicle theft in a lore-friendly way. Survivors can install a hidden killswitch so that only the survivor who installs it is able to drive the vehicle, even if the vehicle is hotwired or another survivor finds the key. The killswitch is installed on the vehicle's engine using the mechanic UI.

description=To install a killswitch, a survivor needs:

description=* 1 Scrap Electronics
description=* 1 Screwdriver (kept)

description=Only the survivor that installs the hidden killswitch can uninstall it. To uninstall a killswitch the survivor needs:
description=* 1 Electricity skill
description=* 1 Screwdriver (kept)

description=When a survivor dies, the killswitches installed by that survivor are automatically removed from all vehicles. I didn't intend for this to happen, but might be interesting in a PvP scenario. I'm willing to change it if enough people think I should.
