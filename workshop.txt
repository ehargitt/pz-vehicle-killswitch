description=This mod is an attempt to curtail vehicle theft in a lore-friendly way. Survivors can install a hidden kill switch so that only the survivor who installs it is able to drive the vehicle, even if the vehicle is hotwired or another survivor finds the key. The kill switch is installed on the vehicle's engine using the mechanic UI.

description=When a survivor dies, the kill switches installed by that survivor are automatically removed from all vehicles. I didn't intend for this to happen, but might be interesting in a PvP/other scenarios. I'm willing to change it if enough people think I should.
