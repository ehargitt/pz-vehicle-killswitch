# Vehicle Killswitch

This mod is an attempt to curtail vehicle theft in a lore-friendly way. Survivors can install a hidden killswitch so that only the survivor who installs it is able to drive the vehicle, even if the vehicle is hotwired or another survivor finds the key. The killswitch is installed on the vehicle's engine using the mechanic UI.

To install a killswitch, a survivor needs:
* 1 Electricity skill
* 1 Scrap Electronics
* 1 Screwdriver (kept)

Only the survivor that installs the hidden killswitch can uninstall it. To uninstall a killswitch the survivor needs:
* 1 Electricity skill
* 1 Screwdriver (kept)

When a survivor dies, the killswitches installed by that survivor are automatically removed from all vehicles. I didn't intend for this to happen, but might be interesting in a PvP scenario. I'm willing to change it if enough people think I should.

Known issues:
* Haven't properly set up localization
* When the server resets, all killswitches are removed. Some help from another modder on this would be appreciated.
* No admin options to remove killswitches
